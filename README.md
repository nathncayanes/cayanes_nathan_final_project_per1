# Cayanes_Nathan_Final_Project_Per1

This is my version of the popular videogame, "Stardew Valley" that I made using Pygame.

## Description

My project uses Pygame, Tiled, and Photoshop to create the game. I used a combination of Photoshop and Tiled in order in order to create visuals of my game such as the character sprites and map. On the other hand, Pygame was the library of Python that I used to create my game loop. This is for both academic and entertainment purposes.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Requires Python 3.11 and Pygame
* Requires the Python module pytmx
* Tested on Windows 11

### Installing

* Download all Python files on my Github (https://github.com/nathncayanes) and all visual elements which are located there as well
* There shouldn't be any modifications necessary and can be ready to play as is

### Executing program

* Download my files on my Github using the link above.
* Open the main.py folder
* Click the Play Button on the top right corner of the main.py file
* Enjoy!

## Help

Make sure that all folders are in the right place and because the program depends on the organization of the files that I have set. Other than that, please make sure that you have the right version of Python and Pygame installed as well as that you haven't accidentally renamed a file.
